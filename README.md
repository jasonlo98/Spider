## Motivation
I forked this project for my dad. He loves the original `spider.exe`, but since executables do not work on iOS, I wanted to build a version nearly identical to the original he could play anywhere.

## Differences from the Original Project
- Increased rendering performance to 60 FPS.
- Added gameplay audio feedback for key actions.
